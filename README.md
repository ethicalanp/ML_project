Implementation of Research Paper titled: An explainable AI based Intrusion Detection System for DNS over HTTPS (DoH) Attacks on CICIDS dataset.

ALgorithms used are: Decision Trees, Random forest, XGboost and then emsemble stacking was done on these algorithms.

Explainable AI is the set of tools which tells the predictions made by machine learning models. We have used shapely for it.
Shapely values calculate the average marginal contribution of a feature x towards a model score. In ML models, it is not possible to just extract a feature when determinig a prediction.
